# DFT Calculations Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to a DFT (Density Functional Theory) Calculations Repository. This repository houses a comprehensive collection of computational chemistry calculations performed using DFT. DFT is a crucial quantum mechanical modeling method in physics and chemistry, used to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems.

This repository primarily focuses on two significant projects: 
1. **Disilene Nanomaterials**: Exploring the properties and behaviors of disilene-based nanomaterials through DFT calculations.
2. **Norbornadiene Metal Complexes**: Investigating the interactions and characteristics of norbornadiene in conjunction with various metal complexes.

The aim is to provide detailed DFT calculations for educational purposes, further research, or as a reference for similar computational chemistry projects.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Scripts and Input Files**: Scripts and input files for DFT calculations using ORCA.
- **Data Sets**: Outputs and datasets generated from these calculations.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of each calculation, including theoretical background and practical applications.
